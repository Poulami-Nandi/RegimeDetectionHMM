# 📊 Regime Detection with Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

This project implements **Market Regime Detection** using **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** to classify different market states and optimize trading strategies. It applies **backtesting techniques** on major stock indices to analyze performance.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
Financial markets exhibit periods of uptrends (bull), downtrends (bear), and sideways movements. Detecting these market regimes allows traders to **adjust strategies dynamically**.

### **Key Features:**
✅ **Uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to classify market regimes** (Bull, Bear, Sideways).  
✅ **Applies leverage & stop-loss strategies** based on market conditions.  
✅ **Backtests trading strategies across multiple indices.**  
✅ **Computes Sharpe Ratio, Drawdowns, and P&L analysis.**  
✅ **Integrates Alpaca API for live trading (pending fix for Paper Trading).**

## 🔧 **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Poulami-Nandi/RegimeDetectionHMM.git
cd RegimeDetectionHMM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Methodology & Implementation
This project follows these key steps:

- 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing
Fetch historical price data for major indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones).
Compute daily returns and log returns.
Handle missing values and normalize data.
- 2️⃣ Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Regime Detection
Train HMM to classify Bullish, Bearish, and Sideways market regimes.
Tune model hyperparameters for better classification.
Visualize market state transitions.
- 3️⃣ Backtesting & Trading Strategy
Implement a risk-managed trading strategy using detected market regimes.
Apply stop-loss and leverage adjustments based on HMM classification.
- 4️⃣ Performance Evaluation
Compute Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, and Cumulative Returns.
Compare strategy performance across multiple indices.
- 5️⃣ Paper Trading with Alpaca API
Integrate with Alpaca API for automated execution (pending fix for Paper Trading).  
Deploy strategy in a simulated trading environment.
